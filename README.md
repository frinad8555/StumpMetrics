# StumpMetrics
StumpMetricsis a relational database system for managing and analyzing comprehensive statistics of cricket teams, players, and matches.
Here, I have uploaded all the relevant files like the ER and Relational Diagrams, Functional Dependencies, and some examples of queries and also the Java API Code.
This was made as a part of the course project for Database Management Systems course during the second semester.
